Hello everyone, thank you guys for coming to our weekly student success meeting and let's just get started.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,000
So I have our list of chronically absent students here and I've been noticing a troubling trend.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
A lot of students are skipping on Fridays. Does anyone have any idea what's going on?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,500
I've heard some of my mentees talking about how it's really hard to get out of bed on Fridays.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,000
It might be good if we did something like a pancake breakfast to encourage them to come.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,500
I think that's a great idea. Let's try that next week.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,500
It might also be because a lot of students have been getting sick now that it's getting colder outside.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,500
I've had a number of students come by my office with symptoms like sniffling and coughing.

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,500
We should put up posters with tips for not getting sick since it's almost flu season.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Like, you know, wash your hands after the bathroom. Stuff like that.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,500
I think that's a good idea and it'll be a good reminder for the teachers as well.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,500
So one other thing I wanted to talk about, there's a student I've noticed here, John Smith.

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,500
He's missed seven days already and it's only November.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Does anyone have an idea what's going on with him?

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,500
I might be able to fill in the gaps there. I talked to John today and he's really stressed out.

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,500
He's been dealing with helping his parents take care of his younger siblings during the day.

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,500
It might actually be a good idea if he spoke to the guidance counselor a little bit.

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,500
I can talk to John today if you want to send him to my office after you meet with him.

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,500
It's a lot to deal with for middle schooler.

20
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Great thanks and I can help out with the family's childcare needs.

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,500
I'll look for some free or low-cost resources in the community to share with John

22
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
and he can share them with his family.

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Great. Well, some really good ideas here today.

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Thanks for coming and if no one has anything else, I think we can wrap up.
