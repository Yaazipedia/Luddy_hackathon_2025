  "summary": "A lot of students are skipping on Fridays. It might be good if we did something like a pancake breakfast to encourage them to come. I think that's a great idea. It might also be because a lot of students have been getting sick now that it's getting colder outside. Stuff like that. I think that's a good idea and it'll be a good reminder for the teachers as well. It might actually be a good idea if he spoke to the guidance counselor a little bit. Great, awesome, really good ideas here today.",
