Hello everyone, thank you guys for coming to our weekly student success meeting and let's just get started.

00:06.500 --> 00:12.000
So I have our list of chronically absent students here and I've been noticing a troubling trend.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
A lot of students are skipping on Fridays. Does anyone have any idea what's going on?

00:17.000 --> 00:21.500
I've heard some of my mentees talking about how it's really hard to get out of bed on Fridays.

00:21.500 --> 00:26.000
It might be good if we did something like a pancake breakfast to encourage them to come.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.500
I think that's a great idea. Let's try that next week.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.500
It might also be because a lot of students have been getting sick now that it's getting colder outside.

00:34.500 --> 00:38.500
I've had a number of students come by my office with symptoms like sniffling and coughing.

00:38.500 --> 00:41.500
We should put up posters with tips for not getting sick since it's almost flu season.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.500
Like, you know, wash your hands after the bathroom. Stuff like that.

00:44.500 --> 00:49.500
I think that's a good idea and it'll be a good reminder for the teachers as well.

00:49.500 --> 00:54.500
So one other thing I wanted to talk about, there's a student I've noticed here, John Smith.

00:54.500 --> 00:57.500
He's missed seven days already and it's only November.

00:57.500 --> 01:00.500
Does anyone have an idea what's going on with him?

01:00.500 --> 01:04.500
I might be able to fill in the gaps there. I talked to John today and he's really stressed out.

01:04.500 --> 01:09.500
He's been dealing with helping his parents take care of his younger siblings during the day.

01:09.500 --> 01:13.500
It might actually be a good idea if he spoke to the guidance counselor a little bit.

01:13.500 --> 01:17.500
I can talk to John today if you want to send him to my office after you meet with him.

01:17.500 --> 01:20.500
It's a lot to deal with for middle schooler.

01:20.500 --> 01:24.500
Great thanks and I can help out with the family's childcare needs.

01:24.500 --> 01:29.500
I'll look for some free or low-cost resources in the community to share with John

01:29.500 --> 01:31.500
and he can share them with his family.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.500
Great. Well, some really good ideas here today.

01:33.500 --> 01:38.500
Thanks for coming and if no one has anything else, I think we can wrap up.
