  "summary": " Yeah, talented assessment. Apologies for the late live edition to the agenda on this one, but one more note on a change we're rolling out with insecure, three-blight weight and then we're establishing a second team within dynamic analysis. It's just a second team within dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within thread insights as well as just two teams. I don't know. The difference between what's happening in thread insights and within dynamic analysis is that this is a split of long feature category. So, I want to big rocks and hot issues section. We've got an awesome response from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. It's one of the things you use to power it. Any of those things are okay. Anybody got any chance to read it yet? Think about it. Perhaps everybody's really busy and they haven't looked yet. I think J. You've already looked at some changes around refinement. Yeah. Like randomness, like you're not scheduled, not PM necessarily actions or issues. And that actually is creating some more additional work like it's just like free time, murder, time on a change of pace. So I think that's helping us to do that. Yeah, we're also seeing some success with we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting. I think with smaller bits of work, we're seeing a higher MRR. Not that's like just inflated, right? Like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it. I was going to say one note on refinement and sacking out this for experimenting with the new section in our planning feature. So looking forward and in there, we're using that is like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement that will most likely be worked on in the next one to be milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover or some engineer to go in and as their issues and make sure they get refined within this month. I can say it now in the secure stage instead of the analyzer team. Looking at the MR rate within sex compared to company wide historically, it runs two to three MRs per engineer per month higher. Thanks, Thomas. Thanks everyone. Good stuff. Okay. All right. Third wrap and the cat, or won't fix security issues. So we've got them for security issues that are subject to. Do we need to do anything related to security findings on the commercial versions of analyzer specifically? For FedRAMP, you're looking at any sets related security issues that have been raised. There is also a link in another issue, a separate issue that has instructions from ActSec on what they would like us to do for a setting of container scanning. There are equivalents in one line to even though they're different meanings. Yeah. Okay. No news is good news on this properly. So good stuff. So with recent changes, we've done a couple different changes with the secure, real government broke out from secure data, up to team, and net is, I just compared the name of my team with my peers. I have one word team names, ops dev, create, etc. So I was thinking about one word name. I've started to get feedback on naming things is really important. I'd get the name, the right kind of things and give them good names. Not sure we're going to change the name, which I'm after it's going to affect anyone, but me. Good idea, bad idea.",
