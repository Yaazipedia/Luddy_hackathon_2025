  "summary": "Yeah, item K. Yeah, apologies for the late, like live addition to the agenda \n\n[Speaker_1]:\n on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out with insecure, three-blight  weight, and then we're establishing a second team within dynamic analysis. It's just a second team within dynamic analysis. We're  not creating a new group, which I think is the same pattern that's happening within  thread insights as well as just two teams. The difference between what's happening in thread insights and within dynamic \n\n[Speaker_0]:\n analysis is that this is a split of long feature category. So we're going to big rocks and hot issues. So did that survey, we've got an awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the  MR rate for the team. It's one of the things you used to power it. Anybody got any chance to read it yet? And think about it, we're not just yet. I think J-E've already looked at \n\n[Speaker_0]:\n some changes around refinement. The big thing we're doing is more  everywhere, like randomness, not schedule, not PM, necessarily actions, or issues. And that actually is creating some more additional work like it's just like three  times more, that one changes the pace, moves just something else, moves the daily. So I think that's helping us succeed there. Yeah, we're also seeing some success with, we've implemented like a weekly refinement \n\n[Speaker_0]:\n meeting, kind of trek in, make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. [Speaker_1]:\n I think with smaller bits of work, we're seeing the higher MRRade. [Speaker_1]:\n I was going to say one note on refinement in magnum analysis, we're experimenting  with the new section in our final picture, from looking forward. And in there, we're using  that as a base find where we add issues that we think need refinement that will most likely  be worked on in the next one to three milestones. So we're using that as kind of a base cover  for some engineer to go in and add their issues and make sure they get refined within this model. Good stuff. Thomas, you've got item B. Okay. All right, third ramp and the can't or won't fix security issues  that way maybe we're maybe having this. So we've got them, the security issues that are subject to  set up. For FedRAMP, you're looking \n\n[Speaker_0]:\n at any since related security issues that have been raised. How far are you going in terms of  orbiting to find anything that hasn't already been identified? There is also a link in another \n\n[Speaker_1]:\n issue, a separate issue that has instructions from ACSEC on what they would like us to do \n\n[Speaker_0]:\n as far as setting up container scanning. They're equivalent to one in line to even though  they're different meanings. Go ahead. They've asked us to group. Is new approval rules? No news is good news on this properly. It's a good stuff. So, with recent changes, we've done a couple of different \n\n[Speaker_1]:\n changes with the secure, real government, secure data up team. My peers have one word team name, op step, create,  et cetera. It also makes  it that I'm going to dash forward. So, I was thinking about a one word name. Naming things is really important. I'd get that to name the right kinds of things and give them  good names. Not sure we're going to change the name,  which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone, but me. But everyone else is in a small way, or others  in a small way, but we'll see. Good idea, bad idea.",
