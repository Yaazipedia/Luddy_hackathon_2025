  "summary": " So it is the SICK meeting secure and govern growth and data science, meaning applied ML, ML ops and anti abuse team meeting. We might get a better name over time. I'm not going to go down to the next one. I think it's going to go down over time. Based on feedback, I work, I'm going to work to do more summarized communications to improve the signal and always reach. I've got the next item as well. So anti abuse is moving product sections from sector data science. So, I think, you want to say anything more about data science or model ups. No, I think for us, we just roll up to data science, everything else stays the same. Yeah. I was going to mention all types of this in here, but Tiago had set up for container security, a bot that weekly, I think it's Mondays or like Sunday, we'll ping the team and ask for volunteer to go and resource that data. I think e-group sign off as expected to be mid December before everyone goes on holiday. Big changes we're moving to do it in work day. But there's an optional self evaluation, which will move into work day and the work that we do as managers will also happen in work day. Thomas get item K. Yeah, apologies for the late at like live addition to the agenda on this one. But one more note on a change we're rolling out within secure pretty lightweight and that we're establishing a second team within dynamic analysis. And so issue is there folks want to play that would like to follow along or ask any questions about it. The plan for right now is I'm going to be serving as a team factoring the EM. What even a call your new team or how will you differentiate. It's just a second team within dynamic analysis. We're not creating a new group. Which I think is the same pattern that's happening within threat insights as well as just two teams know I know that there's tangerine and there's navy. Another two color Thomas I struggled with that one. I think the difference between what's happening and thread insights and within dynamic analysis is that this is a split or long feature category. So I want to big rocks and hot issues section. So did that survey where you got an awesome response rate from the team on how to improve the MR rate for the team. Anybody got a chance to read it yet. And think about it or not just yet. I think J you've already looked at some changes around refinement that was near that you were going to look at for into abuse and report back by the end of the quarter. The big thing we're doing is more whole type of work like random miscellaneous not scheduled not PM necessarily actions or issues. And that actually is creating some more additional work like it's just like free time work. So I think that's helping us succeed there. Yeah, we're also seeing some success with we've implemented like a weekly refinement meeting kind of check in make sure that stories are broken down tiny enough. I think with smaller bits of work we're seeing a higher MR rate. It's debatable whether or not that's like just inflated right like you can work on a small piece of code and ship it. I was going to say one note on refinements in sack analysis were experimenting with the new section in our finding feature is called looking forward. And in there we're using that as like a baseline where we add issues that we think need refinement that will most likely be worked on in the next one to three milestones. Thomas, you want to verbalize your comment? And I think a good bit of that has to do with the. Thanks, Thomas. Thanks everyone. Good stuff. Thomas, you've got item B. Everyone please so good stuff. My peers have one word team names ops dev create et cetera mine is set growth and data science. And I think about one word name I've started to get feedback on it naming things is really important. I'd get lab to name the right kinds of things and give them good names. So I'm not sure we're going to change the name which I'm not sure it's going to affect anyone but me. I'm not sure I'm not sure we'll I think you and I have spoken about this I'm not sure we would get approval to introduce a new name or department level. I would certainly to talk to people off about introducing that in work day. So I would like to add announcements of work anniversaries and new hires to the meeting template. And like the com lottery we have good camaraderie the com lottery there was pretty good. You know firms shadowing me today I think he sat in on the PM meeting as well. It was a pretty good feel of just people really knowing each other well and getting along well. So I think it's a great idea for new hires. I was just going to talk about this is anniversaries and new hires. Yeah, Chiago's great idea for new hires don't care much about work anniversaries. I mean just last week I think it was Phil celebrated his third year. You know because there's like 20 people in that list plus it's team member updates that's not a channel I look at a lot like weekly. I do like being able to celebrate together in this group. So thanks for a praise section like thanks for doing this. I think it's nice to verbalize them. So maybe link to the slack announcements but also verbalize that I know it sounds like a bunch of busy work. I don't want to do things twice. They really add the sections and people use them as they see fit. Don't create busy work for yourself either. Yeah. I like it. We don't do enough for team cohesion team celebration. New hires discretionary bonuses work in a verse rees big feature releases. The new team members and small little introductions. That's good. These employees are actually getting recognized for good work that they've done. And they're kind of siloed busy working on different things. Good stuff there. Thomas, you've got eat. So, you know, I'm going to read it. Right. Yeah. Six engineers that's just going to rule out the same six people. Yeah, rule of six. That's what I kind of think it is. Like if the company. To see. If you set up your team, you know, entries correctly. So yeah. Yeah, well, you know the chart. I mean, I think on somebody's project, we just haven't filled it out. I'll give you like we have the API. Right. I think. I think. I think. I think. I think. I think. I think. I think. I think. I think. I think. So I think if you've listed maintenance. I think. I think. I think. I think. I think. Well, we're going to end with the best news of the day. I think it's the requirement from. Yeah, I know. I'm sure that. I'm sure that. I'm sure that. I'm sure that. I'm sure that. I'm sure that. Yeah. So big. When he returns to work. Yeah. Yeah.",
