0	6500	Hello everyone, thank you guys for coming to our weekly student success meeting and let's just get started.
6500	12000	So I have our list of chronically absent students here and I've been noticing a troubling trend.
12000	17000	A lot of students are skipping on Fridays. Does anyone have any idea what's going on?
17000	21500	I've heard some of my mentees talking about how it's really hard to get out of bed on Fridays.
21500	26000	It might be good if we did something like a pancake breakfast to encourage them to come.
26000	29500	I think that's a great idea. Let's try that next week.
30000	34500	It might also be because a lot of students have been getting sick now that it's getting colder outside.
34500	38500	I've had a number of students come by my office with symptoms like sniffling and coughing.
38500	41500	We should put up posters with tips for not getting sick since it's almost flu season.
41500	44500	Like, you know, wash your hands after the bathroom. Stuff like that.
44500	49500	I think that's a good idea and it'll be a good reminder for the teachers as well.
49500	54500	So one other thing I wanted to talk about, there's a student I've noticed here, John Smith.
54500	57500	He's missed seven days already and it's only November.
57500	60500	Does anyone have an idea what's going on with him?
60500	64500	I might be able to fill in the gaps there. I talked to John today and he's really stressed out.
64500	69500	He's been dealing with helping his parents take care of his younger siblings during the day.
69500	73500	It might actually be a good idea if he spoke to the guidance counselor a little bit.
73500	77500	I can talk to John today if you want to send him to my office after you meet with him.
77500	80500	It's a lot to deal with for middle schooler.
80500	84500	Great thanks and I can help out with the family's childcare needs.
84500	89500	I'll look for some free or low-cost resources in the community to share with John
89500	91500	and he can share them with his family.
91500	93500	Great. Well, some really good ideas here today.
93500	98500	Thanks for coming and if no one has anything else, I think we can wrap up.
